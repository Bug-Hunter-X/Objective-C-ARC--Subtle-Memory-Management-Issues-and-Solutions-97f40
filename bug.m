In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).  Consider the scenario where you create a custom class 'MyClass' with an instance variable referencing another object:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (instancetype)initWithString:(NSString *)string {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        self.myString = string; // Potential problem here
    }
    return self;
}
@end
```

The `strong` attribute in `@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;` indicates that `MyClass` retains a strong reference to the `NSString` object.  This might work well in many cases, but problems can occur in these situations:

1. **Circular Retain Cycles:** If the `NSString` also has a strong reference back to `MyClass`, you have a retain cycle. Neither object will be deallocated, resulting in memory leaks.
2. **Unexpected Object Releases:** If the original `NSString` is deallocated elsewhere (for example, if it was passed to the `MyClass` initializer and then not retained by another object), `self.myString` will become dangling and result in a crash or unexpected behavior.

These problems are less apparent than obvious errors, leading to subtle and difficult-to-debug crashes or memory leaks.
