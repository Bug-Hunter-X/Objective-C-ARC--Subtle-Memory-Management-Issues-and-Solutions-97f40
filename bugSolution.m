To avoid the issues highlighted in `bug.m`, we can use `weak` references where appropriate.  `weak` references don't increment the retain count of the referenced object.  For instance, consider this improved version:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (weak, nonatomic) NSString *myString; // Changed to weak
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (instancetype)initWithString:(NSString *)string {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        self.myString = string; 
    }
    return self;
}
@end
```

By using `weak`, we prevent the creation of a retain cycle and handle potential object releases gracefully.  Ensure that the `NSString` is managed correctly in the rest of your code to prevent early deallocation.

In situations where you want to ensure the object remains valid, a `strong` reference is indeed needed.  This decision should be made cautiously, and always keep in mind potential retain cycles and dangling pointer issues.
